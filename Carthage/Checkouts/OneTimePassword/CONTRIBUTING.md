## Getting Started

1. Check out the latest version of the project:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/mattrubin/OneTimePassword.git
  ```

2. In the OneTimePassword directory, check out the project's dependencies:
  ```
  cd OneTimePassword
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

3. Open the `OneTimePassword.xcworkspace` file.
> If you open the `.xcodeproj` instead, the project will not be able to find its dependencies.

4. Build and run the "OneTimePassword" scheme.


## Managing Dependencies

OneTimePassword uses [Carthage][] to manage its dependencies, but it does not currently use Carthage to build those dependencies. The dependent projects are checked out as submodules, are included in `OneTimePassword.xcworkspace`, and are built by Xcode as target dependencies of the OneTimePassword framework.

To check out the dependencies, simply follow the "Getting Started" instructions above.

To update the dependencies, modify the [Cartfile][] and run:
```
carthage update --no-build --use-submodules
```
