dor1an2FA is a simple, free, and open source [two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication) app
based on [Matt Rubin's Authenticator] (https://github.com/mattrubin/Authenticator) with a twist.
It is combined with a browser extension in order to communicate each other via screen-camera communication.

It has all the advantages of Matt Rubin's Authenticator like helping keep your online accounts secure by generating unique one-time passwords, which you use in combination with your other passwords to log into supporting websites. The simple combination of the password in your head and the rotating passwords generated by the app make it much harder for anyone but you to access your accounts.

- Easy: Simple setup via QR code, ["otpauth://" URL](https://code.google.com/p/google-authenticator/wiki/KeyUriFormat), or manual entry
- Secure: All data is stored in encrypted form on the iOS keychain
- Compatible: Full support for [time-based](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) and [counter-based](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226) one-time passwords as standardized in RFC 4226 and 6238
- Off the Grid: The app never connects to the internet, and your secret keys never leave your device.

Adding the ability to transfer the generatoed 6-digit password token to the laptop automatically via screen-camera communication with this features:

- No need to type the codes.
- Requester hostname check in order to minimize phishing attacks.

## Getting Started

1. Check out the latest version of the project:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ch4r1ieb/dor1an2FA.git
  ```

2. In the dor1an2FA directory, check out the project's dependencies:
  ```
  cd dor1an2FA
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

3. Open the `dor1an2FA.xcworkspace` file.
> If you open the `.xcodeproj` instead, the project will not be able to find its dependencies.

4. Build and run the "dor1an2FA" scheme.


## Managing Dependencies

Authenticator uses [Carthage] to manage its dependencies, but it does not currently use Carthage to build those dependencies. The dependency projects are checked out as submodules, are included in `dor1an2FA.xcworkspace`, and are built by Xcode as target dependencies of the Authenticator app.

To check out the dependencies, simply follow the "Getting Started" instructions above.

To update the dependencies, modify the [Cartfile] and run:
```
carthage update --no-build --use-submodules
```

[Carthage]: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage
[Cartfile]: Cartfile
